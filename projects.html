            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <p>In my free time, as well as learning front-end development skills, I like to work on projects that I find interesting. Here are a few
                examples of my work.

                <h2>Desktop Calculator</h2>
                <object type="image/svg+xml" data="https://gh-card.dev/repos/Alexxanderr20/RPS.svg?link_target=_blank"></object>
                <p>My first project was a calculator app, where I taught myself
                    HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript. I spent a couple of weeks learning 
                    the basics. I also managed to learn how to use Git and GitHub,
                    as well as how to deploy my projects to GitHub Pages.

                <h2>Rock-Paper-Scissors</h2>
                <object type="image/svg+xml" data="https://gh-card.dev/repos/Alexxanderr20/calculator.github.io.svg?link_target=_blank"></object>
                <p>In this project, I spent more time focusing on the JavaScript, compared 
                    to the previous project. I learned how to use functions, as well as how
                    to use the DOM to manipulate the HTML and CSS. This program also uses
                    a random number generator to determine the computer's choice.
