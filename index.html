        <h1>Hello, I'm Edward!</h1>
        <p>I'm a self-taught developer software engineer from the United
            States. I enjoy building things that live on the internet. I
            develop exceptional websites and web apps that provide intuitive,
            pixel-perfect user interfaces.

        <h1>Technical Skills</h1>
        <p>Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently! They're a mix
            of languages, libraries, and frameworks. I'm always excited to learn new
            technologies, and I hope to add to this list soon.

        <h1>Personal Projects</h1>
        <p>In my free time, as well as learning front-end development skills, I like to work on projects that I find interesting. Here are a few
            examples of my work.
        </p>

            <img src="portfolio-image-1.jpg" alt="Desktop Calculator">
            <h2><a href = "https://alexxanderr20.github.io/calculator.github.io/" target="_blank">Desktop Calculator</a></h2>
            <p>My first project was a calculator app, where I taught myself
                HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript. I spent a couple of weeks learning 
                the basics. I also managed to learn how to use Git and GitHub,
                as well as how to deploy my projects to GitHub Pages.
            </p>

        <div class="portfolio-item">
            <img src="portfolio-image-2.jpg" alt="Project 2">
            <h2><a href = "https://alexxanderr20.github.io/RPS/" target="_blank">Rock-Paper-Scissors</a></h2>
            <p>In this project, I spent more time focusing on the JavaScript, compared 
                to the previous project. I learned how to use functions, as well as how
                to use the DOM to manipulate the HTML and CSS. This program also uses
                a random number generator to determine the computer's choice.
