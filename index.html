        <h1>Hello, I'm Edward!</h1>
        <p>I'm a self-taught developer software engineer from the United
            States. I enjoy building things that live on the internet. I
            develop exceptional websites and web apps that provide intuitive,
            pixel-perfect user interfaces.

        <h1>Personal Projects</h1>
        <p>In my free time, as well as learning front-end development skills, I like to work on projects that I find interesting. Here are a few
            examples of my work.

            <h2>Desktop Calculator</h2>
            <p>My first project was a calculator app, where I taught myself
                HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript. I spent a couple of weeks learning 
                the basics. I also managed to learn how to use Git and GitHub,
                as well as how to deploy my projects to GitHub Pages.

            <img src="portfolio-image-2.jpg" alt="Project 2">
            <h2>Rock-Paper-Scissors</h2>
            <p>In this project, I spent more time focusing on the JavaScript, compared 
                to the previous project. I learned how to use functions, as well as how
                to use the DOM to manipulate the HTML and CSS. This program also uses
                a random number generator to determine the computer's choice.

        <div>
            <img src="portfolio-image-3.jpg" alt="Project 3">
            <h2>Bitwise Calculator</h2>
            <p>This is a project that I did during my Intermeidate Programmming class
                where I learnt C. This program is a bitwise calculator that can perform
                bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT. It can also perform 
                bit shifts to the left and right.
